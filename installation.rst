Installation
============

To install UrbanFootprint install these steps. 

**Note:** UrbanFootprint is currently under active development. Very soon you'll be able to get an UrbanFootprint instance up and running on your own using these instructions with provided demo data. Contact `Calthorpe Analytics <mailto:UFupdate@calthorpe.com>`_ if you'd like to be notified when that is available, and in the meantime contact `Nathaniel Roth <mailto:neroth@ucdavis.edu>`_ for access to a demo site. 

Document Conventions
--------------------

Code that you would type in on the command line will look like:
::
  sudo mkdir new_directory

These commands can generally be cut and pasted into the command line. 

**Hint:** windows user using putty can select the text and then paste it into the terminal window by right clicking.

*Each line that appears in a section of code should be entered as an individual line, executed, and then the next line should be entered and executed.*

<Password> Indicates that you should enter the password for the appropriate account. Contact Evan Babb or Nathaniel Roth for the default password used internally. Because connections to the terminal the Amazon EC2 systems require a ssh key the virtual machines should be relatively safe from administrative access, but posting passwords on the internet is generally poor practice.


Setup
-----
These instructions assume that you've got an Ubuntu 14.04LTS server that has just been created. They have been tested on Amazon Web Services EC2 instances.

System requirements
___________________

There are no set system requirements and performance has not been tested across a wide variety of hardware.

To date the common EC2 instance used for running UrbanFootprint has been a "m3.2xlarge" instance. These have 8 available CPUs, 30GB of memory, and 2 80GB SSD storage drives associated with them by default as of 11/14/2014.

Access to the repository
________________________
The code is under active development, contact `Calthorpe Analytics <mailto:UFupdate@calthorpe.com>`_ if you'd like to be notified when the code is publicly available. 

*Note: As of 3/23/2015, we expect to have the code up and available through a publicly accessible repository in the next week or so.

Using Amazon
____________

AWS Account
+++++++++++
Set up an Amazon Web Service account. This will require a credit card to cover costs.
http://aws.amazon.com/



Install PuTTY (Windows)
++++++++++++++++++++++++

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

PuTTY is a commonly used set of utilities for remote connection to Linux and Ubuntu computers from windows.
I recommend using the Windows installer that installs "everything except PuTTYtel." As of this writing the version is PuTTY v0.63. 

SSH Key
+++++++

Follow Amazon's instructions for creating a SSH key pair.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html

AWS Security Profile
++++++++++++++++++++

Inbound traffic:

+----------+-----------+------------+-----------+
|Type      |Protocol   |Port Range  |Source     |
+==========+===========+============+===========+
|SSH       |TCP        |22          |0.0.0.0/0  |
+----------+-----------+------------+-----------+
|HTTP      |TCP        |80          |0.0.0.0/0  |
+----------+-----------+------------+-----------+
|Custom TCP|TCP        |8081        |0.0.0.0/0  |
+----------+-----------+------------+-----------+

These settings are worth reviewing with your system administrator.
It would be a good idea to restrict the SSH sources to an IP range that exists within your organization for improved security. The same is true of the Custom TCP o n Port 8081 if you're assigning an IP address directly to the machine or paying for a fixed one from Amazon. 

the HTTP port 80 is the standard port that almost all web traffic uses and as such needs to be left open to all sources that may want to use UrbanFootprint. You could use this to limit access to only your organization.


Outbound traffic:
All traffic and all protocols on all ports to all destinations are open. i.e. there's no restrictions on outbound traffic.

Create Instance
+++++++++++++++

**Step 1: Choose AMI**

Ubuntu 14.04LTS 64 Bit (select the Hardware Virtual Machine or HVM version). 

**Step 2: Choose Instance Type**

A *m3.2xlarge* instance seems to work well, and at present has a cost of $0.56 per hour (which may change).

Note: I have run it on a m3.large instance and the reduced number of cpus and ram. It is possible, and is cheaper, but is not as effective as the larger instance if you need to run any of the complex analytical modules.  

**Step 3: Configure Instance**

No changes from the defaults 

**Step 4: Add Storage**

The M3.2xl has only 8 GB of persistent EBS storage. In recent installs, I've been hitting this limit and adding is worth while. Current pricing for General Purpose EBS is About $0.10 per GB per month. In some of my examples, I've increased the storage to 16GB.

**Step 5: Tag Instance**

Give the machine a Name by entering a name in the value to the right of the Name box.

**Step 6: Configure Security Group**

Select the security profile set up in the previous step.

Choose the *Select an existing security group.* Then pick the group that you created earlier.

**Step 7: Review Instance Launch**

You will get two warnings.

The first is that your instance is not eligible for the Free Tier of usage (i.e. it will cost money to run)

The second is that your instance is open to the world. Anyone will be able to connect to your instance if they have a user name and password using the web. In general we want this, but if you plan to use it internally, work with your IT staff to refine the security group settings to limit access to your office.


Initialize the instance.
 

Installation
------------

What follows are the instructions for installing the software components of UrbanFootprint. It does not yet include loading data into it to create a fully operational installation

Step 1: Log in
______________

Log in to your server using a SSH terminal connection. Make sure that you have "sudo" (administrative) permissions.

Using PuTTY:

Open putty, copy the Public IP address from the Instance into the "Host Name (or IP address)" box. Leave port 22 as is.

Under Saved sessions, Type in a name for the connection profile you're creating, and click Save.

On the left side, expand the "Connection" section, and then the "SSH".

Under "Auth", browse for and find the Private Key file that you created above.

Then go back up to the "Session" click on the name that you selected before, and click "Save" again to save the location of the key.

Now, click "Open" and accept the "Server Host key not cached..." message by clicking Yes or accept.

Each time you start the instance, you will need to update the IP address, and accept the "Server Host Key" message.

When asked for a username on the AWS virtual machine, use: *ubuntu*

Step 2: Install git
___________________
The first significant installation step is to make sure that you have the "git" installed. Git will be used to connect to the the source of all of the code for operating UrbanFootprint and the instructions for its configuration.
::
  sudo apt-get install git

You will be asked to approve the installation. Enter Y+return to do so.

Step 3: Clone the repository
____________________________

This will create a local copy of the source code (aka, cloning the repository) and instructions used by the computer to install it on your local computer. The branch Release-1.3 is a stable version that will remain static with the exception of bugfixes.
::
  git clone -b Release-1.3 https://bitbucket.org/calthorpe/urbanfootprint.git 

You will be asked for your bitbucket account name and password

Downloading the materials might take a few minutes.

If you type:
::
  ls

You will now see an additional item listed in the "home" folder of the account you're logged in with called "urbanfootprint." It will probably be blue text (in PuTTY) indicating that it is actually a folder.


Step 4: Run the installation script
___________________________________

This step will run the installation of UrbanFootprint. It will take ~1hour to run, but will need some input from you near the beginning.
::
  cd urbanfootprint
  
*A shortcut: you can type in "cd urb" and then hit TAB to autocomplete. Doing this you only need to type in enough characters to unambiguously identify the folder/file that you want. i.e. if the folder is empty, you could type "cd u" then TAB.

This will change your directory to the urbanfootprint directory created by cloning the repository.
::
  sudo ./setup.sh

This will start the script.

The script first runs an update on the system's software and will ask you to approve several installations and modifications. For each of these type Y+return.

If you are asked about a GRUB update, choose the default option to keep the existing configuration by just pressing Enter.

You will then be asked to create a name for your server. Enter a logical name for it. For example: uf_ice

You will need to then enter your bitbucket account name and password. What happens here is that your server is registering itself with the bitbucket account using a SSH key. This will enable it to complete the rest of the software installation without needing further use of the user name and password.

When prompted for a client, enter "sacog" to set up to use the demonstration data prepared for this set of instructions.

If the installation pauses on:
:: 
  git rev-list HEAD --max-count=1 --pretty --oneline
  
Press "q" to continue.

You will know it's done when the text stops scrolling by and you see something that looks like:
::
  ubuntu@ip-172-31-36-172:~/urbanfootprint$

At this point you can go get coffee, it will probably take about an hour to complete (on an EC2 m3.2xlarge instance, other systems may vary significantly).


Step 5: Configuration
_____________________

After the installation completes, you will need to do some initial configuration of the installation.

Set the user and virtual environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Do the following steps:
To log in as the "calthorpe" user under which most of the server is setup. You'll need to enter the calthorpe password.
::
  su calthorpe

You'll be able to tell that this worked if you see your command line looking something like:
::
  calthorpe@....$

Activate the Python virtual environment that UrbanFootprint will run in.
::
  source /srv/calthorpe_env/bin/activate
  
You'll be able to tell that this worked because the command line you're working at will start with "(calthorpe_env)."

To move to the folder holding the configuration settings.
::
  cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint/footprint

To make a copy of the default settings file for customization
::
  cp local_settings.py.default local_settings.py.mycopy

To create a link between the configuration settings copy we made and the file name expected by UrbanFootprint.
::
  ln -sf local_settings.py.mycopy local_settings.py

Step 6: Add yourself as an administrator
________________________________________
We need to edit the settings.py file to add you as an administrator.
::
  nano settings.py

Then use the arrow keys to scroll to the ADMINS section. Insert the following after the last line in the list (and remove the others if desired).
::
  ADMINS = (
    ('Your Name', 'you@example.com'),
  )

use the arrow keys to update your name and email leaving the quotes.

Exit by using Ctrl+x, and then typing Y when asked to save the file.

Your user name is your name, and default password is <firstname>@uf

Step 7: Check the services
__________________________

Run:
::
  sudo supervisorctl status

You should then see the following:
:: 
  ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-7:~$ sudo supervisorctl status
  calthorpe_www                    RUNNING    pid 7336, uptime 0:30:17
  celery_flower                    RUNNING    pid 7340, uptime 0:30:17
  celery_worker                    RUNNING    pid 7339, uptime 0:30:17
  celerybeat                       RUNNING    pid 7342, uptime 0:30:17
  node_socketio                    RUNNING    pid 7341, uptime 0:30:17
  tilestache                       FATAL      Exited too quickly (process log may have details)

Tilestache will be unable to run until we give it some mapping data to work with.

This concludes the primary installation of UrbanFootprint.

Step 8: Transfer base data to server
____________________________________

For simplicity let's put the data that we'll load into urbanfootprint in either home folders for either the "Calthorpe" user or the "Ubuntu" user. If you're already logged in as Calthorpe, I suggest option 2 as the most direct route to get the sample data onto the machine. Option 1 will put the data into the Ubuntu home folder most easily.

**Option 1:**

Use FileZilla (or similar SFTP capable FTP Client) to get your data onto the server.

Establish a connection profile, and specify the use of the username (ubuntu for an EC2 instance) and make sure that your pageant install is loading the correct ssh key. 

Transfer the <filename>.dump file to the server

**Option 2**

Switch to the calthorpe home folder:
::
  cd ~

Then use the "curl" tool to download the database dump file.
::
  curl -O http://downloads.ice.ucdavis.edu/~neroth/uf/yolo_stage.dump

Step 9: Create a staging database
_________________________________

Switch your user name to the calthorpe user and activate the virtual environment that UrbanFootprint runs in. You will need to do activate the virtual environment any time you're making changes to UrbanFootprint's configuration from the command line.

if you don't see the start of the command prompt looking like:
::
  calthorpe@....$

Switch to the calthorpe user.
::
  su calthorpe

And enter the calthorpe password: <Password>

Activate the virtual environment
::
  cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint/
  source /srv/calthorpe_env/bin/activate

After activating the virtual environment your command prompt should look like:
::
  (calthorpe_env)calthorpe@...$


Create a staging database
::
  createdb stage_db

If you get an error stating that the database "calthorpe" does not exist, create the calthorpe database for convenience.
::
  createdb calthorpe

Then:
::
  createdb stage_db

Add the postgis extension to stage_db
::
  psql -d stage_db -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

Then import the database dump to the staging database.
::
  pg_restore -d stage_db /home/calthorpe/yolo_stage.dump

This is assuming the data you're loading is in a file called "yolo_stage_db.dump" and that it is in the home directory of the calthorpe user. Adjust the path to the dump file as needed.

Step 10. Prepare for data import 
________________________________

First, a work around that is needed on Amazon instances to work within the security system.

Note: If you're doing a non-amazon installation then you'll want to substitute "local_prod" in place of "amazon_local" and can skip past the next few lines to "configuring the connection to the staging database".

Copy the PEM file that you're using to connect to the server to the /home/calthorpe/.ssh

First upload it the same way you did the data dump file to /home/ubuntu/ 

Then do the following which will move the pem file to the calthorpe user folders and set permissions so that it can be used as a ssh key.
::
  cd /home/calthorpe/.ssh
  sudo mv /home/ubuntu/<name>.pem <name>.pem
  sudo chmod 600 <name>.pem
  sudo chown calthorpe:calthorpe <name>.pem

Update the fabric host files so that they recognize that key/pem file
::
  cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint/fabfile/hosts
  nano __init__.py

In the def amazon_local(): section, update the path at:
::
  env.key_filename = '/home/calthorpe/.ssh/pemfile.pem'

To point to the pem file you just copied into place.

Then save the changes with Ctrl+X and Y to save the changes.

Next we need to make sure that the file is not over written the next time we pull an update of the code (which will happen shortly).
::
  git commit -a -m "adjusted local settings"

This records our changes into the local copy of the git repository so that they are not over written.

Connecting to the staging database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Last, we need to tell UrbanFootprint how it is going to connect to the staging database.

This tutorial is built around the SACOG data model so we'll use that now.
::
  cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint/footprint/client/configuration/sacog
  nano sacog_init.py

Look for a section that like: (approximatley line 45, use Ctrl+C to show the line number where the cursor is at present).
::
  def import_database(self):
    if settings.USE_LOCAL_SAMPLE_DATA_SETS:
      ...
    else:
      return dict(
        host = 'localhost',
        database = 'stage_db',
        user = 'calthorpe',
        password = '<Password>'
      )

Edit the host = and database = to point to 'localhost', and the name of your staging database respectively (so they may look like the example above)

And then commit our changes to git.
::
  git commit -a -m "adjusted staging database settings"

Step 11. Build UrbanFootprint
_____________________________

Some of these steps may take a long time to complete

Switch back to the main urbanfootprint folder.
::
  cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint

Specify the client name and settings (takes about 2min.)
::
  fab amazon_local client:sacog

*Note: Tilestache will show an error message if the spatial data has not been loaded previously.*

Import the staging database settings (takes about 2min.)
::
  fab amazon_local local_settings:stage
*Note: Tilestache will show an error message if the spatial data has not been loaded previously.*

Do a code update. This is an abbreviated version of the installation that we did earlier. (takes about 2 min.)

This is also how you would update the code you're using to a newer version, so be cautious. If you're not looking to fix a problem you're having, or in need of a new feature, you probably don't wan to run this.
::
  fab amazon_local deploy
  
If an error is generated that looks like:
:: 
  HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
  ERROR:boto:Unable to read instance data, giving up
  No handler was ready to authenticate. 1 hand

It is safe to ignore.


Do the data import and system setup. (takes 30min+)
::
  fab amazon_local build:prod

You will be asked twice if you want to continue because if you have an existing UrbanFootprint database of the same name it will be completely overwritten by this step. 
**Approving this process will destroy all existing base data and scenarios for this geographic area on this virtual machine.** 

if when running the build process you get an error about being unable to delete/drop the urbanfootprint database, run:
::
  dropdb urbanfootprint
  
And then rerun the build command.

Check that the Postgresql setup is configured to respond to requests from Tilestache
::
  sudo nano /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf

Scroll down to the bottom, and look to see if the line
::
  local   all             tilestache                              trust
  
Is above or below:
:: 
  local   all             all                                     peer

If the tilestache line is not above the other (or if it is not present), edit the file so that it looks like:
::
  # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
  # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
  local   all             tilestache                              trust
  local   all             all                                     peer
  # IPv4 local connections:
  host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
  # IPv6 local connections:
  host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5
  # Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
  # replication privilege.  
  #local   replication     postgres                                peer
  #host    replication     postgres        127.0.0.1/32            md5
  #host    replication     postgres        ::1/128                 md5

Then save the file and exit. Restart postgresql
::
  sudo service postgresql restart

And restart all of the UrbanFootprint services.
::
  sudo supervisorctl restart all
 

Step 12. Log In
_______________

Copy the IP address from your Amazon EC2 control console and paste it into the address window of a web browser (Chrome seems to be the preferred one). 

Your log in will be the first name that was entered in the administrator box, and the password will be that "<firstname>@uf" 

Other Useful Items
------------------

Dumping a Database
__________________

To dump a database:
::
  pg_dump -Fc [database] > [dumpfile]

example:
::
  pg_dump -Fc stage_db > yolo_stage.dump  


Checking Service Status
_______________________

type:
::
  sudo supervisorctl status

You can replace "status" with "restart" to restart the primary services.

Log Files
_________

Log files for most of UrbanFootprint are in:
::
  /var/log/supervisor/

You'll need to use sudo to access them.
::
  sudo nano /var/log/supervisor/celery.log  

Connect to the Postgres Database Using PGAdmin
______________________________________________

**This requires extreme caution** When connecting directly to the database you could corrupt it badly.

When you're setting up your PuTTY connection to the server, you can set up a tunnel by:
1. Select "Connection" in the left panel
2. Select SSH
3. Select Tunnels
4. Source Port: Enter a port number (5432 is the standard for a local postgres install, I suggest picking 5433 or another one that you have not used already)
5. Destination: localhost:5432

Remember to go back to Session and save your tunnel configuration to your saved session

Connect to your UF machine using that saved session.

Open PGAdmin.
Create a new server connection.
* Name: <pick a descriptive name>
* Host: localhost
* Port: the source port that you entered above
* Username: calthorpe
* Password: <Password> 

Remove All Scenarios
____________________

With the calthorpe_env active and when logged in as the calthorpe user:
::
  ./manage.py footprint_init --skip --delete_clones
  
Create an Alias for UF
______________________

Add the following as the last line of /home/calthorpe/.bashrc using nano
::
  alias uf="cd /srv/calthorpe/urbanfootprint && source /srv/calthorpe_env/bin/activate"

Then you'll either need to log out and log back in, or run:
::
  . .bashrc
  
Layer Config
____________

To modify default layer settings
::
  ./manage.py shell
  from footprint.main.models import Layer
  layers = Layer.objects.filter(db_entity_key__icontains="existing_land")
  for layer in layers:
  layer.visible = True
  layer.save()
  [press enter to end the for loop]
